# Interview Dry-Run
Project Interview Dry-Run simulates an in-person interview. All six tasks has been completed in less than a hour. Although some additional time was taken to add few Unit and property based tests. 

Answers to all questions can be found in `src/com/vycius/interview`.

## Questions
> Question 1 - What’s your favorite tool or library for Android? Why is it so useful?

> Question 2 - You want to open a map app from an app that you’re building. The address, city, state, and ZIP code are provided by the user. What steps are involved in sending that data to a map app?

> Question 3 - Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. The method signature is: “public static String compress(String input)” You must write all code in proper Java, and please include import statements for any libraries you use.

> Question 4 - List and explain the differences between four different options you have for saving data while making an Android app. Pick one, and explain (without code) how you would implement it.

> Question 5 - Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes. The method signature is: “public static < T > boolean findPath(GraphNode< T > start, GraphNode< T > end)”. Assume you have a “GraphNode” class that has a getChildren() method, which returns a List< GraphNode< T >> object. You must write all code in proper Java, and please include import statements for any libraries you use (no need to import GraphNode).

> Question 6 - What are your thoughts about Fragments? Do you like or hate them? Why?
