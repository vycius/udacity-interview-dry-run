> Whatâ€™s your favorite tool or library for Android? Why is it so useful?

My favorite Android library is ButterKnife. It helps to minimize boilerplate of binding views
also no more setting `OnClick` listeners by hand. ButterKnife has fantastic error messages such as that view hasn't been binded.
With additional Intellij plugin it can generate all required view binds from xml layout file.
