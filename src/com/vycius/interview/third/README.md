> Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. The method signature is: “public static String compress(String input)” You must write all code in proper Java, and please include import statements for any libraries you use.

Implemented solution without loops by using only java 8 streams. Also added few unit tests using `JUnit` and property base test using `JUnit QuickCheck`
